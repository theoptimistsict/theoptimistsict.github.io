			<p>In this three day camp at the Vodacom Innovation park we got to learn a lot of interesting things. The camp has offerd ladies the platform to create their own websites and work together towards achieving such.In our website programming we got to use HTML,CSS and Bootstrap. From this we learnt a lot.At this camp we learnt that women are very powerful creatures and through working together we can reach greater heights.We've also learnt how to create a working circut.Also we wrote a few quizes.<br>We'd like to give thanks to Vodacom and Basali Tech.<br>Special thanks to 'M'e Setsoto Hlohlomi and her team<br>.
